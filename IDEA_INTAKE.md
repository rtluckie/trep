# Idea Intake
## 15-Minute Gate Before Any Real Work

> This checklist exists to prevent me from
> confusing *interest* with *merit*.

If an idea can’t pass this in 15 minutes, it does not deserve further attention — yet.

---

## Step 1 — Name It (2 minutes)

- Working name (boring, descriptive):
  - `<idea-short-name>`
- Date captured:
  - YYYY-MM-DD

**Rule:**  
No clever branding. No metaphors.

---

## Step 2 — One-Sentence Test (3 minutes)

Fill this in **without editing**:

> “This idea addresses **<problem>** experienced by **<specific customer>**,  
> by **<approach>**, resulting in **<outcome>**.”

If this feels vague or fluffy, stop.

---

## Step 3 — Constraint Check (5 minutes)

Answer **yes / no** only.

- ⬜ No overlap with my day job
- ⬜ Does not require me to be CEO/operator
- ⬜ Clear path to revenue
- ⬜ Obvious acquirer category
- ⬜ Potential IP defensibility
- ⬜ Solvable with hard/soft engineering
- ⬜ Feels like a *real* problem, not a vibe

If any are “no” → **park the idea**.

---

## Step 4 — Energy Signal (3 minutes)

Answer honestly:

- Does this energize me *calmly*? ⬜
- Or does it make me restless / fantasize? ⬜

Only calm energy is allowed.

---

## Step 5 — Decision (2 minutes)

Choose one:

- ⬜ Proceed to Phase 1 (Brain Dump)
- ⬜ Park (interesting, not now)
- ⬜ Kill (document why)

**If parked or killed**, write one sentence explaining why.

## Final Rule

If this takes longer than 15 minutes,
I am already violating the process.
