# New Idea Quickstart

Use this when an idea passes the 15-minute gate.

## 1) Create the folder

```
ideas/idea-<short-name>/
```

## 2) Copy templates

Copy everything from:

```
ideas/_template/
```

## 3) Fill the idea README first

Update:

- `README.md` (state + one-sentence summary + next step)

If the README is not clear, stop and fix it before doing anything else.

## 4) Proceed in order

Follow the process in `PROCESS.md`.

If any phase fails, park or kill the idea and document why.
