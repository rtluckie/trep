# Weekly TREP Review
## 30-Minute Ritual (Once Per Week, Max)

> This review exists to prevent slow drift,
> sunk-cost fallacy, and idea hoarding.

No skipping.
No expanding.
No guilt.

---

## Step 1 — Open the Pipeline (5 minutes)

Open:
- `00_PIPELINE.md`

Scan:
- SHAPING
- SCREENING
- INVESTOR-READY

Ask:
- Do these still deserve attention?

---

## Step 2 — Reality Check Each Active Idea (10 minutes)

For each idea not parked or killed, answer:

- What *actually* changed this week?
- What did I learn that reduced uncertainty?
- What question is still blocking progress?
- Is the next step clear and small?

If nothing changed → flag it.

---

## Step 3 — Energy Audit (5 minutes)

Answer honestly:

- Did I over-invest emotionally?
- Did I polish instead of validate?
- Did I avoid a hard decision?
- Did TREP bleed into rest, family, or health?

If yes to any → reduce scope immediately.

---

## Step 4 — Make Hard Moves (5 minutes)

For each idea, choose one:
- ⬜ Advance
- ⬜ Pause
- ⬜ Park
- ⬜ Kill

Update:
- Idea `README.md`
- `00_PIPELINE.md`

Document *why*.

---

## Step 5 — Reset Intentions (5 minutes)

Write **one sentence**:

> “Next week, the only TREP work I intend to do is:  
> `<specific, bounded action>`”

Nothing else is allowed.

---

## Hard Rules

- Max 2 active ideas at once
- No new ideas during review
- No adding scope during review
- If an idea survives 4 reviews with no movement → park or kill it

---

## Closing Reminder

> TREP is not a second job.
>  
> It is a disciplined filter for good ideas,
> not a place to accumulate them.

End review. Close vault. Move on.
