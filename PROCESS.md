# TREP Process
## Getting Ideas Out of My Head and Onto Paper (Without Lying to Myself)

> This process exists to **externalize thinking**, not to force progress.
>  
> Speed is not the goal.  
> Clarity is.

## Guiding Principles

- Ideas decay when left in my head
- Writing reveals weak thinking quickly
- Early structure prevents late rework
- Killing ideas early is a success, not a failure
- This process protects **time, energy, and integrity**

---
## Phase 0 — Mental Quarantine

**Goal:**  
Create distance between the idea and my identity.

**Rule:**  
An idea is not “mine” until it survives writing.

**Actions:**
- Create a folder:  
  `ideas/idea-<short-name>/`
- Copy templates from:  
  `ideas/_template/`
- Do **not** pitch it to anyone yet
- Do **not** name it cleverly
- Do **not** research competitors yet

**Output:**  
Empty folder + blank files

---
## Phase 1 — Brain Dump (Unfiltered)

**Goal:**  
Get the idea out of my head *without organizing it*.

**File:**  
`NOTES.md`

**Prompt:**
- What keeps bothering me about this?
- Where have I seen this problem in the wild?
- Who complains about this (explicitly or implicitly)?
- What would a “dumb but effective” solution look like?
- Why does this feel solvable by *me*?

**Rules:**
- Bullet points only
- No editing
- No structure
- No judgment

**Timebox:**  
20–30 minutes max

**Stop when:**  
My head feels quieter.

---

## Phase 2 — Problem Crystallization

**Goal:**  
Decide whether the *problem* is real before designing anything.

**File:**  
`PROBLEM.md`

**Questions to answer (plain English):**
- Who has this problem?
- How often does it occur?
- What happens if it’s not solved?
- Who pays the cost?
- How is this handled today?

**Hard Check:**
If I cannot explain the problem in **5 sentences**, stop.

**Outcome:**
- Clear problem → continue
- Vague, aesthetic, or hypothetical → park or kill

---

## Phase 3 — Solution Sketch (Resist Over-Engineering)

**Goal:**  
Describe the solution without building it.

**File:**  
`SOLUTION.md`

**Questions:**
- What does the solution *do*?
- What does it explicitly *not* do?
- What is the key technical insight?
- What makes this difficult for others?

**Rules:**
- No diagrams yet
- No implementation details
- No tech stack decisions

**Hard Check:**
If the solution sounds like:
- a platform
- an ecosystem
- an AI-powered anything

Rewrite it.

---

## Phase 4 — Reality Screen

**Goal:**  
Stress the idea against reality *before* falling in love with it.

**Files:**
- `MARKET.md`
- `RISKS.md`

### MARKET.md
Answer honestly:
- Who buys this?
- Who uses it?
- Why would they buy it *now*?
- How many such buyers plausibly exist?
- How do they currently justify spend?

### RISKS.md
List only real risks:
- Adoption friction
- Regulatory exposure
- Technical uncertainty
- IP weakness
- Substitution risk

**Rule:**  
If risks feel uncomfortable, good — keep going.

---

## Phase 5 — IP First Pass

**Goal:**  
Decide if this is an **IP play** or a **speed play**.

**File:**  
`IP.md`

**Questions:**
- What might be patentable?
- What is clearly not?
- What existing products or companies feel adjacent?
- Is this worth a provisional patent discussion?

**Hard Check:**
If there is no defensibility story, the exit must be obvious.

---

## Phase 6 — Compression

**Goal:**  
Reduce everything to investor-readable artifacts.

**Files (in order):**
1. `artifacts/elevator.md` (from `ELEVATOR.template.md`)
2. `artifacts/one-pager.md` (from `ONE_PAGER.template.md`)
3. `artifacts/pitch-deck.md` (from `PITCH_DECK.template.md`)

**Rule:**
- Each artifact must feel *simpler* than the last
- If clarity decreases, stop and go back

---

## Phase 7 — State Decision

**Goal:**  
Decide what happens next — deliberately.

**File:**  
`README.md`

Set:
```markdown
**State:** SEED | SHAPING | SCREENING | INVESTOR-READY | PARKED | KILLED
```


Questions:
	•	Is this worth more of my time?
	•	Does this align with my constraints?
	•	Is the next step clear and small?

If no:
Park or kill it. Document why.

⸻

Kill Criteria (Use Early, Use Often)

Kill the idea if:
	•	The problem is aesthetic, not operational
	•	The buyer is vague or hypothetical
	•	IP is weak and speed advantage is unclear
	•	It requires me to operate a company
	•	It only works if everything goes right

Killing early is a win.

⸻

Final Reminder

The goal is not to “advance ideas.”

The goal is to discover which ideas deserve existence outside my head.

This process exists to help me tell the difference.
