# IP First Pass

Goal: decide if this is an IP play or a speed play.

Questions:
- What might be patentable?
- What is clearly not?
- What existing products or companies feel adjacent?
- Is this worth a provisional patent discussion?

Hard check:
If there is no defensibility story, the exit must be obvious.
