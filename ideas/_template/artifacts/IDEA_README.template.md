# <Idea Name>

**State:** SEED | SHAPING | SCREENING | INVESTOR-READY | PARKED | KILLED  
**Owner:** Ryan  
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## One-Sentence Summary
<Plain English. No buzzwords. No marketing.  
If this takes more than one sentence, stop and rewrite.>

---

## Why This Exists (Problem Reality)
- Who experiences this problem?
- How often does it occur?
- What happens if it is not solved?
- Who ultimately pays the cost?
- Why existing solutions are unsatisfactory

> This section must describe **pain**, not opportunity.

---

## The Core Insight
- What did I notice that others missed?
- Why does this insight matter technically or operationally?
- Why does this insight work *now*?

If there is no clear insight, this is not ready.

---

## The Solution (High-Level Only)
- What the solution does
- What it explicitly does **not** do
- The minimum viable form of the solution
- Why this approach is difficult to replicate

> No implementation details. No tech stack. No diagrams.

---

## Who This Is For
- Primary customer
- Buyer vs user (if different)
- Environment where this lives (enterprise, industrial, consumer, etc.)

If the buyer is unclear, this is a red flag.

---

## Market Reality Check
- How this is handled today
- Why buyers tolerate current pain
- What would trigger a buying decision
- Approximate scale (order-of-magnitude only)

> Honesty beats TAM theater.

---

## IP & Defensibility
- What may be patentable
- What is clearly not
- Structural or architectural moats
- Known adjacent products or companies

If IP is weak, note why speed or niche focus might compensate.

---

## Exit Thesis
- Likely acquirer categories
- Why this fits their roadmap
- What problem this solves *for them*

If there is no plausible buyer, stop here.

---

## Risks & Unknowns
- Technical risks
- Market adoption risks
- Regulatory or legal risks
- IP risks

> List risks plainly. No mitigation spin.

---

## Current Open Questions
- ?
- ?
- ?

If there are no open questions, you are lying.

---

## What I’m Optimizing For
- Fast de-risking
- IP clarity
- Clean handoff to operators
- Honest investor conversations

---

## What I Am Explicitly Not Doing
- Running day-to-day operations
- Acting as CEO
- Fundraising beyond early validation
- Building a brand or community

This constraint is not negotiable.

## Next Small Step
<One bounded, low-effort action that reduces uncertainty.  
If this step feels big, break it down further.>

## Notes
<Free-form. Facts only. No hype.>
