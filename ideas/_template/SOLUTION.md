# Solution Sketch

Goal: describe the solution without building it.

Questions:
- What does the solution do?
- What does it explicitly not do?
- What is the key technical insight?
- What makes this difficult for others?

Rules:
- No diagrams yet
- No implementation details
- No tech stack decisions

Hard check:
If the solution sounds like a platform, an ecosystem, or an AI-powered anything,
rewrite it.
