# Problem Crystallization

Goal: decide whether the problem is real before designing anything.

Questions to answer (plain English):
- Who has this problem?
- How often does it occur?
- What happens if it is not solved?
- Who pays the cost?
- How is this handled today?

Hard check:
If I cannot explain the problem in 5 sentences, stop.
