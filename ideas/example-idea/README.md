## One-Sentence Summary
We reduce unplanned downtime in mid-size food plants by tracing contamination
events to a single equipment node within hours, not days.

---

## Why This Exists (Problem Reality)
- QA teams lose days isolating contamination root causes
- Recalls are expensive and reputationally dangerous
- Current tracing depends on manual logs and tribal knowledge

---

## The Core Insight
- Plants already collect enough signals to narrow root causes
- The missing piece is a clean, low-friction lineage map
- This is solvable now because sensors and logs are common

---

## The Solution (High-Level Only)
- A lightweight lineage graph that ties batches to equipment
- No full MES replacement, no new hardware requirements
- Built to sit alongside existing logs and sensors

---

## Who This Is For
- Primary customer: Quality leads in mid-size food plants
- Buyer vs user: Director of QA buys, line supervisors use
- Environment: Regulated manufacturing

---

## Market Reality Check
- Plants track batches but not equipment lineage
- Recalls are tolerated because root cause analysis is slow
- Buying triggers include near-miss recalls and audit pressure
- Scale: thousands of plants in North America

---

## IP & Defensibility
- Potentially patentable data reconciliation approach
- Know-how in mapping messy operational logs to a graph
- Adjacent products: full MES suites and traceability vendors

---

## Exit Thesis
- Likely acquirers: MES vendors, QA software platforms
- Fits roadmaps for traceability and compliance analytics
- Solves faster recall containment for their customers

---

## Risks & Unknowns
- Data quality may be worse than expected
- Adoption friction if setup requires too much ops time
- Regulators may not accept generated lineage without audits

---

## Current Open Questions
- What minimum data sources are required to be useful?
- How quickly can lineage be built in a pilot plant?
- What price point is tolerable for mid-size plants?

---

## What I'm Optimizing For
- Fast de-risking
- IP clarity
- Clean handoff to operators
- Honest investor conversations

---

## What I Am Explicitly Not Doing
- Running day-to-day operations
- Acting as CEO
- Fundraising beyond early validation
- Building a brand or community

---

## Next Small Step
Interview two QA leads about their last recall root-cause process.

## Notes
Fictional example for the TREP framework.
