# Solution

Build a lightweight lineage map that links batches to equipment nodes using
existing logs and sensor data. The system ingests common log formats, normalizes
them, and produces a simple trace path for QA teams. It avoids replacing MES and
focuses on one plant line at a time. The key insight is that partial logs can
still establish a reliable chain when reconciled correctly.
