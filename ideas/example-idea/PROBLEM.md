# Problem

Quality teams in mid-size food plants cannot quickly trace contamination
to a specific machine or batch handoff. The process is manual, slow, and
often relies on memory and partial logs. When a recall happens, root-cause
analysis can take days. This increases financial losses and regulatory risk.
Plants keep patching the process because replacing MES systems is expensive.
