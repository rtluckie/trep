### Summary
We reduce contamination root-cause time in mid-size food plants using lineage
maps built from existing logs and sensors.

---

### The Problem
- QA teams cannot trace contamination quickly
- Root-cause analysis is manual and slow
- Recalls are costly and risky

---

### The Solution
- A lineage graph linking batches to equipment
- No MES replacement required
- Focused on one plant line at a time

---

### Market
- Primary customer: QA leadership in food plants
- Buyer vs user: QA director buys, analysts use
- Market size: thousands of mid-size plants
- Buying trigger: recall risk and audit pressure

---

### Competitive Landscape
- Full MES suites are heavy and slow to deploy
- Traceability vendors focus on reporting, not lineage
- This is hard to copy without log reconciliation know-how

---

### IP & Defensibility
- Data reconciliation method may be patentable
- Operational know-how is a barrier

---

### Revenue Model
- Annual plant license
- Paid pilot for initial setup

---

### Exit Thesis
- Likely acquirers: MES vendors, QA platforms
- Fits roadmaps for traceability and compliance

---

### Current Status
- Stage: SHAPING
- Validated: contamination tracing is slow
- Unknown: data availability and setup time

---

### The Ask
Two QA lead interviews and access to sample logs.
