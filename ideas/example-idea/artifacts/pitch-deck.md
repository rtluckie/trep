# QuietLineage
## Contamination Traceability, Fast

---

# Slide 1 - The Problem
- QA teams trace contamination manually
- Root-cause can take days
- Recalls are expensive and risky

---

# Slide 2 - Why Now
- Sensors and logs are already in place
- Audit pressure is increasing
- Plants need faster containment

---

# Slide 3 - Existing Solutions
- Full MES replacements are costly
- Reporting tools do not map lineage
- Manual logs are unreliable

---

# Slide 4 - The Insight
- Partial logs can still form a reliable chain
- Lineage graphs compress complex data into a path

---

# Slide 5 - The Solution
- Lightweight lineage map from existing logs
- No new hardware
- Deploy per line, not whole plant

---

# Slide 6 - Market
- Mid-size food plants
- QA directors buy, analysts use
- Thousands of plants in North America

---

# Slide 7 - IP & Defensibility
- Log reconciliation method may be patentable
- Operational know-how is a moat

---

# Slide 8 - Revenue Model
- Annual plant license
- Paid pilot for setup and validation

---

# Slide 9 - Exit Landscape
- MES vendors and QA platforms
- Accelerates recall containment

---

# Slide 10 - The Ask
- Access to sample logs
- Two QA lead interviews
