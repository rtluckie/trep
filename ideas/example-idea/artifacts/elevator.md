# Elevator Pitch - QuietLineage

## The One-Liner
We solve contamination root-cause delays for mid-size food plants by mapping
batch-to-equipment lineage from existing logs, resulting in faster containment.

## The Problem (1 sentence)
QA teams lose days tracing contamination because batch and equipment data
is fragmented and manual.

## Why Existing Solutions Fail
- Full MES replacements are expensive and slow
- Manual logs cannot produce reliable lineage fast

## The Insight
Partial logs are enough when reconciled into a lineage graph.

## The Solution
A lightweight lineage map built from existing logs and sensors.

## Why This Is Interesting to Buyers
MES and QA platforms can offer faster recall containment without ripping systems.

## What I'm Looking For Right Now
Introductory calls with QA leads to validate data availability and workflow.
