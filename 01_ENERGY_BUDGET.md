# TREP Energy Budget

I treat TREP like a **finite resource**, not a hustle.

## Weekly Allocation
- Max: 3–5 focused hours
- Zero guilt weeks are allowed

## Hard Rules
- No TREP work when exhausted
- No TREP work at the expense of health or family
- No more than 2 active ideas at once

## Signs I’m Over-Investing
- Polishing instead of validating
- Writing decks before clarity
- Fantasizing about scale
- Avoiding hard kill decisions

If any appear → pause.
